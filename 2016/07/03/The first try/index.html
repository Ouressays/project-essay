            <p>Joseph Conrad,a Polish writer says that the belief in a supernatural source of evil is not necessary. Men alone are quite capable of every wickedness.Mrs.Column with her daughter’s death really creepy: almost completely severed his mother’s neck, when people try to raise her.However,Mrs.Column’s head fell off.Her head was tore down the large pieces with the skin, after the killing was thrown to the ground from the fourth floor window, a piece of flesh;Mrs.Column’s daughter was strangled and then stuffed into the fireplace in the flue.(the comment of “The Murders in the Rue Morgue” from www. chinasina.com).This passage is cited from “The Murders in the Rue Morgue”, which was written by Edgar Allen Poe in 1841.It has been recognized as the first modern detective story.Poe referred to it as one of his “tales of ratiocination”.(Wikipedia.).The writer of “The Cask Of Amontillado”——Edgar Allen Poe, who is the pioneer of horror tales and psycho-analytic fiction in the Unite States.Meanwhile, he just peeps at the murder from a purely objective perspective.In a sense, Poe opened up people’s intellectual, that elusive mystery is no longer just a narrative of fear and confusion.From this passage we can discover that Poe’s keen mind, careful thinking plus precisely plans and one after another murder scene with various clues interlocking, gives readers infinite imaginary spaces, he also leaves a tremendous suspense to the readers. </p>
<p>Carl Jung says that the healthy man does not torture others, generality is the tortured who turn into torturers. Montrosor has been suffered from Fortunato’s insult for many years He planted the seeds of hatred.Moreover, Fortunato’s family motto is that “Nemo me impune lacessit.”, which is a Latin motto with a meaning of “no one can harm me unpunished”.This motto was first carved on the most ancient and most noble order of the Thistle.It implies that Montrosor’s characteristic——-an eye for an eye.As a consequence, Montrosor sets a trap for later’s revenge.The reason why this murder was able to succeed is to plan prudently.Although Montrosor still bears a grudge to Fortunato within his deeply mind, he has never been displayed his own mood,plus,he never let Fortunato to arouse the suspicion to himself.As an old saying: “Seize plus make full use of other people’s desires, you just grab his weak point.” Montrosor successfully did this.The avaricious self-righteous of good wine became a tremendous vulnerability for Fortunato also this weak point was used by Montrosor to lure Fortunato. Fortunato just keeps saying:“The Amontillado!”.It is obviously that Fortunato is lured by Montrosor. Finally he trigs Fortunato to entrap into the trap step by step.During this period, Montrosor is feasted with his process of revenging </p>
<p>In addition,Montrosor also utilizes that the disadvantages of——Fortunato is still under the illusion of Amontillado because of  getting drunk. Amontillado is a variety of sherry wine characterized by being darker than fino but lighter than oloroso. It is named after the Montilla region of Spain, where the style originated in the eighteenth century, although the name ‘Amontillado’ is sometimes used commercially as a simple measure of color to label any sherry lying between a fino and an oloroso. An amontillado sherry begins as a fino, fortified to approximately 13.5 percent alcohol with a cap of flor yeast limiting its exposure to the air(Wiki).So we know that the environment in the cellar is gloomy and cold.In addition,this harsh environment resulted in making Fortunato keep coughing. Montrosor also pretends to be a pair for considering Fortunato’s sake, repeats persuading Fortunato to leave and pretends to worry about Fortunato. In addition, he feigns to let Fortunato know that he plans to lead another friend Luchesi to see the Amontillado.Along with he uses humankind’s common nature——the more you get, the more you want to get.Also Montrosor catches his biggest weak point——wants to show off his connoisseurship in wine.The other place he utilizes human’s normal mental,he told his servants that he wants to go out for a few days, he foresees that the servants will get away and he can take advantage of the occasion to attract Fortunato to his home and can easily go on the murder that he has planned well.</p>
<p>The entire murdering for Montrosor, he also has the sacrifice. It must be understood that neither by word nor deed had I given Fortunato cause to doubt my good will. I continued as was my wont, to smile in his face, and he did not perceive that my smile.Now was at the thought of his immolation(The Cask Of Amontillado).Plus we can know that it is fact that Fortunato just  have no idea about Montrosor’s anger.And that is why the story is so tragic and satiric. </p>
<p>Furthermore,I was so pleased to see him, that I thought I should never have done wringing his hand(The Cask Of Amontillado).As you know that the reason why he greets Fortunato with “excessive warmth,” is that Montrosor gets a chance to regulate his perfect planning murder. Montrosor uses superb acting to deceive Fortunato that he is friendly to himself. He seemingly miraculously comes up with a cask of Amontillado during carnival, which Fortunato can scarcely believes. He tells Fortunato:”You are a man to be missed,” and after Fortunato says he won’t die of a cough, Montresor agrees. His family motto is “No one insults me with impunity” and he is carrying a trowel. Yet Fortunato suspects nothing, and is so shocked when Montresor chains him to the wall, he doesn’t even try to fight. (enotes  <a href="http://www.enotes.com/topics/cask-amontillado/critical-essays).In" target="_blank" rel="external">http://www.enotes.com/topics/cask-amontillado/critical-essays).In</a> the second place, He had on a tight-fitting parti-striped dress, and his head was surmounted by the conical cap and bells(The Cask Of Amontillado).Acording to this paragraph,we can know that Fortunato is wearing a costume similar to that of a jester.Plus,this can imply that Fortunato is a person who prefer insulting and laughing at people.This is the reason why Montresor wants to revenge by planning  a perfect murder. Last but not least,”I have my doubts,” I replied; “and I was silly enough to pay the full Amontillado price without consulting you in the matter. You were not to be found, and I was fearful of losing a bargain.(The Cask Of Amontillado).This phrase uses the peak of psychologically,he uses words of compliment Fortunato onto the top of vanity.</p>
<p>At the end of this passage,Montrosor says :“In pace requiescat!”It means God bless you.This is full of satire and also show Montrosor’s exciting after his perfect planning murder successfully regulate.The Cask of Amontillado” uses a first-person narrator (a narrator that is a character in the story), and, sometimes, first-person narrators can be unreliable.The entire story shows that how he enjoyed his revenge.It was now midnight, and my task was drawing to a close (The Cask Of Amontillado).The narrator chooses midnight to regulate his murder so that he can have enough time to prepare the death wall and can slowly enjoys his process of revenge.</p>
<p>The thing we can not deny is that Fortunato is take the consequences because of his insult to others. ”Let us go, nevertheless. The cold is merely nothing. Amontillado! You have been imposed upon; and as for Luchesi, he cannot distinguish Sherry from Amontillado.”(The Cask Of Amontillado).From this paragraph,we can see that nearly all his thought is that other people are not better than himself .The feeling of superiority in his words.This made people feel uncomfortable and unhappy.However, Montrosor in Edgar Allen Poe’s pen, is a typically a characteristic who shows out the darkest side. Montrosor always follows his family motto:“Nemo me impune lacessit.”And successfully he did it. Nietzsche once says that:“When you look into the abyss, the abyss is also looking at you.”And here exists a forever argument——-whether Montrosor is guilty or Fortunato just takes his consequence.</p>
